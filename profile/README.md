# Cardio Pulmonary Institute's Computational Resources

Welcome to the the Cardio Pulmonary Institute's Computational Resources (CPI-CR). This platform is dedicated to sharing a wide array of computational tools and resources developed by various work groups within the Cardio Pulmonary Institute (CPI).

## About CPI

The CPI is a collaborative effort that brings together researchers from the universities of Giessen and Frankfurt, along with the Max-Planck-Institute (MPI) for Heart- and Lung-Research in Bad Nauheim. Established in 2019, the CPI is an Excellence Cluster that focuses on understanding cardio-pulmonary diseases and developing new treatments. With a funding of approximately 45 million euros from the DFG over the next 7 years, the CPI aims to make groundbreaking contributions to cardiopulmonary science and the development of novel treatments.

Our team consists of basic, clinical, and translationally-oriented researchers and experts who are dedicated to translational research. Our interdisciplinary approach allows us to study mechanisms of cardio-pulmonary diseases using a range of model systems, from cell culture experiments to animal models, and to integrate these findings with clinical data.

Importantly, the CPI is equipped to conduct translational studies that validate our basic research results in patients in a clinical setting. Physician-scientists of the CPI are also actively involved in clinical studies at every stage to evaluate novel therapeutics and therapies.

## Our GitHub Organization

This GitHub Organization serves as a central hub for sharing the computational tools and resources developed by the various work groups within the CPI. Our goal is to facilitate collaboration and accelerate the pace of research in the field of cardio-pulmonary diseases.
